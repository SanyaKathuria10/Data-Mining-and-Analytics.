Question :
Extend Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based clustering by exploiting the fact that a GMM is also a density model. Use the data from the image. (ilk-3b-1024.tif).

Perform the clustering as in hw2, say with k=5.
Then, for every pixel calculate its likelihood under the GMM density model.
Tune and fix a threshold on the likelihood values such that points that have low likelihood now fall into a new class â€“ anomalies.
